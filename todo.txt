X. discrete map sizes. env init with v0,v1,v2

BUG:
reset function performed right after init and does the same job twice. can we just call reset from init?

1. Add complexity:
    Observation changes wall blocks
    UAV movement (over walls and anywhere from 1 block to range blocks)
    Observe All
    Interactions (probability of hit)
  X Environment initialization
    gray team
    training environments (different game complexities, small, medium, large, no civilian, survive (?))
    end condition when no units and time

1.5
    training file intermediate feedback

3. Conda env cleanup

X Red team can't win
X ugv bug disappearing bug
X don't let uavs go on flags
X game end on other team dead bug
