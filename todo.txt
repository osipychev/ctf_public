BUG: Random place two units in same square (haven't tested yet, but probably an issue)



1. Add complexity:
    Observation changes wall blocks
    UAV movement (over walls and anywhere from 1 block to range blocks)
    Reward (game over, time, units alive, units_dead (?))
    Observe All
    Interactions (probability of hit)
    Environment initialization
    gray team
    training environments (different game complexities, small, medium, large, no civilian, survive (?))
    end condition when no units and time

1.5
    training file intermediate feedback

2. Consts in const file
3. Conda env cleanup
