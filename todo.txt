Denis
X. discrete map sizes. env init with v0,v1,v2

BUG: Random place two units in same square (haven't tested yet, but probably an issue) 
Denis note: impossible. map_gen does a check and put new entity in free space only

BUG:
reset function performed right after init and does the same job twice. can we just call reset from init?

1. Add complexity:
    Observation changes wall blocks
    UAV movement (over walls and anywhere from 1 block to range blocks)
    Reward (game over, time, units alive, units_dead (?))
    Observe All
    Interactions (probability of hit)
  X Environment initialization
    gray team
    training environments (different game complexities, small, medium, large, no civilian, survive (?))
    end condition when no units and time

1.5
    training file intermediate feedback

2. Consts in const file
3. Conda env cleanup
