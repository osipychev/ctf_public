BUG:
reset function performed right after init and does the same job twice. can we just call reset from init?

1. Add complexity:
    Observation changes wall blocks
    UAV movement (over walls and anywhere from 1 block to range blocks)
    Observe All
    Interactions (probability of hit)
  X Environment initialization
    gray team

1.5
    training file intermediate feedback

3. Conda env cleanup



Action length checker (try except)
merge master into deep_rl
test rl with new controls
